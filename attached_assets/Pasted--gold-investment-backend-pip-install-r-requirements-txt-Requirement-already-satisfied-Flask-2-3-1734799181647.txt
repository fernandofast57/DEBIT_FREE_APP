INFO: pip is looking at multiple versions of flask to determine which version is compatible with other requirements. This could take a while.
ERROR: Cannot install Werkzeug==2.3.3 and flask==2.3.3 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.

The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested Werkzeug==2.3.3
    flask 2.3.3 depends on Werkzeug>=2.3.7

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip attempt to solve the dependency conflict

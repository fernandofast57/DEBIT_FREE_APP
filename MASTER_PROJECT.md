# GOLD INVESTMENT PLATFORM - Project Implementation Plan

## Implementation Strategy: Backend-First Approach

### Phase 1: Backend Core (Current Focus)

1. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Complete Polygon RPC integration
   - Implement transaction batching
   - Test smart contracts on testnet
   - Implement Noble ranks system contracts

2. **API Development**
   - Authentication system
   - Transaction handling
   - Bonus calculation endpoints
   - Noble ranks management
   - Transformation service
   
3. **Database & Models**
   - User management
   - Transaction tracking
   - Noble ranks progression
   - Account balances
   
4. **Integration Testing**
   - API endpoint testing
   - Blockchain integration tests
   - Transaction flow tests
   - Performance testing

### Phase 2: Frontend Development (After Backend)

1. **User Interface**
   - Dashboard components
   - Transaction forms
   - Noble ranks display
   - Account management

2. **State Management**
   - User session handling
   - Real-time updates
   - Transaction status tracking

3. **API Integration**
   - Connect all backend endpoints
   - Implement error handling
   - Add loading states

4. **UI/UX Testing**
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Responsive design
   - User flow testing

## Development Approach

### Backend Development Rules
1. Complete one feature fully before moving to next
2. Write tests before implementation
3. Document API endpoints immediately
4. Test blockchain integration on testnet first

### Frontend Development Rules (When Ready)
1. Build reusable components
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Focus on mobile-first design
4. Use proper state management

## Current Priority
Focus on completing the blockchain integration and core API endpoints before moving to any frontend work. This ensures a solid foundation and prevents future backend changes from breaking the frontend.

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for all services
2. Integration tests for API flows
3. Smart contract specific tests
4. Load testing for critical endpoints

## Security Measures
1. Rate limiting
2. Input validation
3. Transaction signing
4. Secure session management

# Development Standards

## Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Use TypeScript for frontend code
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use JSX for React components
- Follow ESLint configuration for JavaScript/TypeScript

## Naming Conventions
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., GoldTransaction, NobleRelation)
- Functions/Methods: snake_case (e.g., calculate_commission, verify_transaction)
- Variables: snake_case (e.g., user_balance, gold_amount)
- Constants: UPPER_CASE (e.g., MAX_PURCHASE_AMOUNT)
- React Components: PascalCase (e.g., TransformationForm)
- Database Tables: snake_case (e.g., gold_accounts, noble_relations)

## Documentation
- All public APIs must have docstrings
- Update GLOSSARY.md when adding new terms
- Keep API_DOCUMENTATION.md in sync with code changes
- Document all environment variables in .env.example
- Include JSDoc comments for TypeScript/JavaScript functions
- Add inline comments for complex business logic

## Testing
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical workflows
- Mock external services in tests
- Test security features thoroughly
- Include performance tests for critical paths

## Security
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Rate limiting for public APIs
- Secure password storage (bcrypt)
- Two-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- JWT token validation
- CORS configuration
- XSS protection
- SQL injection prevention
- Regular security audits

## Version Control
- Descriptive commit messages
- One feature per branch
- Squash commits before merging
- Code review required for all changes
- Keep commit history clean
- Tag significant releases
- Follow semantic versioning

## Error Handling
- Use custom exception classes
- Implement proper error logging
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include error details in responses
- Handle async/await errors properly
- Implement circuit breakers for external services

## Performance
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Optimize database queries
- Use connection pooling
- Monitor API response times
- Implement rate limiting
- Use async operations when beneficial
- Optimize frontend bundle size

## Monitoring
- Log all critical operations
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor system health
- Set up alerts for anomalies
- Track user analytics
- Monitor blockchain transactions
- Log security events

## Code Organization
- Follow modular architecture
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Use dependency injection
- Keep components small and focused
- Follow RESTful API design
- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- Implement service layer pattern

## Deployment
- Use Replit for deployment
- Configure proper environment variables
- Set up logging
- Enable monitoring
- Configure proper security headers
- Implement backup strategy
- Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Best Practices
- Write self-documenting code
- Follow DRY principle
- Implement SOLID principles
- Use type hints in Python
- Implement proper validation
- Follow responsive design principles
- Use proper error boundaries in React
